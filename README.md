# SecurePass - Password Manager

SecurePass allows users to store all the passwords safely in one place! Login or create an account to access all of your stored passwords.
Users can easily add, edit or delete passwords as they please. Rest assured, your passwords are safeguarded within our database, stored in a highly secure hashed form. Your passwords are exclusively yours to maintain and control.
